Relevant Information: David Brown was found deceased in his hotel room bed at 3:15 PM on January 4 by the hotel maid. There were no apparent signs of foul play, and a cryptic note was left behind, so police initially assumed that David had taken his own life. However, a detective was called in just to be safe, and he immediately suspected foul play. David was a young man in his 20s, was engaged to be married, and was a successful businessman who also taught Sunday school. On the surface, he seemingly had no reason to commit such an act.

Since David passed in his hotel room and there was no sign of forced entry, the detective theorized that if he had been slain, it had to be one of the three people closest to him, as he didn't trust people easily. The three people closest to him were his sister, Emily, who often assisted him with teaching Sunday school; his brother, Mark, who ran a small, semi-successful business; and, David's fiancée, Sarah.

Finding no obvious motive among the three, the detective held off on declaring David's end a suicide until after the medical examiner performed an autopsy. David had apparently perished from a lethal injection that killed him instantly. He was found approximately 11 hours after he passed.

Still confounded by the evidence, the detective then began scouring the note for clues. It read:

Jan 04/2009 4:10 AM

"My loved ones,

Sarah, Sis, Mark, I would just like to tell you how sorry I am. Blame God for why I am to die today. Blame Him. Seek Him if you want to know why I did leave you. Do not mourn my death. Please move on.

Goodbye,
David"

The detective found it strange that a seemingly pious and devout man would take his own life and then blaspheme against God, but the handwriting was verified to be David's. After some thought, the detective deduced that David had been slain and arrested one of the three suspects.

David was a successful businessman and wouldn't likely wake up early at 4:10 AM to write a letter, suggesting he knew he was going to die.
David's intelligence and silent personality imply he would have left a hidden clue.
Emily, his sister, teaches Sunday school and might have access to drugs.
Mark, his brother, might have been jealous of David's success.
Sarah, his fiancée, might have had personal reasons for conflict with David.
The phrase "Blame God" in the letter could hint at something hidden in the Bible or a religious clue.
The unusual mention of time in the letter might indicate a significant clue.
The use of "Sis" instead of Emily’s name could be intentional and meaningful.
Possible secret clue: a connection between the Bible, the time 4:10, and "Sis."
